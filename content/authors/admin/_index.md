Studying Water Resources Engineering at the University of Guelph as part of the Morwick G360 Groundwater Research Institute Group Directed by Dr. Beth Parker. As part of my thesis project, I work very closely with Active Distributed Temperature Sensing (A-DTS) where I have collected, processed and analyzed temperature data collected with A-DTS. After a realized affinity for extracting important insights from large data sets, I became heavily involved in the world of programming and have since become experienced in python, R and C/C++. I am currently contributing to a package for processing A-DTS data in R, and working on side projects scraping data from websites and using machine learning to make meaningful predictions.
